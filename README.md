## 🔬 Research & Experience

My research background encompasses several core areas within electrical engineering and computer science:

- **🛰️ Satellite Networking**
  > My work focused on the architecture and protocols for resilient space-based communication systems.

- **🧠 Semantic Communication (SemCom)**
  > I investigated novel methods for information transmission that prioritize the *meaning* of the data over mere accuracy, enhancing efficiency in communication systems.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise into the emerging field of **Embodied AI** (Artificial Intelligence). This involves studying how intelligent agents can perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world, bridging the gap between theoretical AI and real-world robotics or autonomous systems.
